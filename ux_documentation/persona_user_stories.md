- Natalia
    - Profile :  
    Natalia is a anxious real estate agent that looks into every details. She’s a very cautious buyer, especially 
    when shopping online. She likes to compare solutions and think twice before concluding any action. 
    She is new to 3D printing world and previous customers feedback are essential for her to be confident in 
    purchasing a specific product.  
    Therefore she needs to be able to save a design product to retrieve it when she’s made up her mind. She would also track 
    delivery status very often to make sure everything runs smoothly as supposed to.  
    - MVP :  
    She can save and retrieve any available product in a wish list to save her time in searching same products over 
    and over for a quick check. The platform provides updates of the delivery status to the customer and email service 
    to receive notification upon successful delivery.  
    While email alerts should be functional, the delivery tracking is actually faked since 
    there is of course no products printed nor delivered.
